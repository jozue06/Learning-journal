#Learning Journal

### January 16th 2018


Today we learned a **lot** about CSS layout, boxes and forms. and also finaly got into some juicy js function stuff! things seem to be coming together a lot better in my head too. all the parts we were reading and working on seemed to be really random and unattached the first week. but now they are coming together.

learned a lot today.

got a lot of links from other students for help too. I really like our class!
