# Learning Journal Day 14

## Janurary 29th 2018

Wow,, i just looked at that date and it does **not** seem like it has been almost a whole month since we started!  We are making a lot of progress.

I'm feeling more confident in myself inspite of the emotional roller-coaster of "today i'm ahead" "now i'm soo far behind" "did i do this right?" "is there a right way to do this?". trying to be stable and confident in the process and learning. 

Going over the growth mentality again was really helpful and reminds me i want to run so far when my brain is on fire!! :)
