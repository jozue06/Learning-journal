### PHEW!

**what a weekend and week its been so far!** I was still reeling from the bad decision to take my test in such a hurried way and disappointed in my results all the way through the weekend into monday night! I'm doing much better today, we got through a lot of stuff in two days and i'm REALLY excited to get started on our final project!

I was having some feelings of potential issues in our team, but those faded tonight during our lab 14 and 15's together, as well as we all shared some pretty raw and vulnerable stories in a very healthy and natural way and it bonded us really well together. I think we are going to be good!
