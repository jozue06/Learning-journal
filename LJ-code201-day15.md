# Learning Journal Day 15

## January 31st 2018

Whew! I feel really good and proud about my progress this week! I was really feeling the pressure last week but this week is going reall well.

I learned a lot about JS and how it interacts and builds things on its own if you tell it to in the right way. and I was also able to use a lot of those things in my code and actualy mess with it and see how things react to each other.

The CSS part is coming up and it is really fun to me too, I like to style and design stuff.

Hesitantly looking forward to Bus Mall :D we'll see what happens.
