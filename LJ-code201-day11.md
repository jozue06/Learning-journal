# Learning Journal day 11

## January 20th 2018


**lab 5!!!!** What a crazy lab!!!!! it took me soooo long to understand how to do it! I knew on paper what needed to happen, I just had no idea how to ask the computer to do it...but after about 5-6 hours I got it! :D lol it was really really frustrating and stressing but also challenging and I love a challenge, especially when I understand that it is not an impossible challenge.

I learned a lot of patience with myself this time. I wanted to push myself so much harder to "power through" but it just caused more stress and confusion. I had to keep taking slow small baby steps, and it eventually worked.

All the classmates and TA's were so helpful and patient with me too!

I also helped out a lot of people with git and github as much as I could. That was fun too, I like helping people when I understand what to do.
