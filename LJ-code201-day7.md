#Learning Journal day 7

## January 15th 2018


Today we didn't have classes officially, it was Martin Luther king JR day. Campus was open tho, so some of us met there to do co-work.

It was really cool for me, and I'm glad I went. I was able to help a few of them a little bit, and I also got help from them a lot too!

looking forward to getting deeper into the classes starting tomorrow too.
