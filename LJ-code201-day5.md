#Learning Journal day 5

## January 12th 2018

####the game:

**wow!** I _actually_ did it. I **DID** it! I'm really proud of myself for finally figuring out a better way through loops and functions and statements in the game. its semi playable now, and i'm happy with it in the time i had. 

#####HTML & CSS:

I'm not loving the html side of the page/site right now. but it will take shape. I was really focused on working with the java, its seemed _much_ more interesting than the html+css. but i managed to connect some of the info from the .js into the html side too, which i wanted to do.

######overall:

Overall i'm really happy with how i managed to push through the road blocks and problems. I googled a lot for bits and pieces and made them fit and work for what i was trying to do in this case. makes me feel very good. 

I don't really understand %100 what is going on or what it is doing all the time (the js) but I think and **hope** that will come :) 

I'm really liking all the challenges but also like that i am taking them and overcoming them. it feels really good!
