# Learning Journal day 13

## January

Really feeling the "heat" now in week three :) really tired after work and class for a little over two weeks. but I'm also learning a lot. 

its a really fast pace, and I do not understand most of what I am doing. Some imposter syndrom coming on too. I think I'm on track, but I don't know.
