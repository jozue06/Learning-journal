# Learning Journal Day 16

## February 5th !!! Already!?

So time is flying by!!! I had no idea it was already Feb!  Salmon cookies was a real challenge, but also really fun, it took me all the way into Feb!

I learned so much with salmon cookies, and i'm really really proud of myself for staying through, and getting to the fun parts of challenging stuff. It was really great to help people out too. once i was less stressed about my own code i could relax and realize what was actually going on in the code, and then understand more and i was more able to help the others out too.

The one on one with our teacher Rachel went well too, i'm glad we have that opportunity. I was really encouraged by it. Looking forward to the final project two weeks, and pushing out something cool and fun and challenging with a team!
