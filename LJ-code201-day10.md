# Learning Journal 10

## January 18th 2018

Working on the pair programming today was really fun! the actaul coding part was pretty simple and easy. I learned to have a lot of patience and read the instructions very thoroughly and take the work at a good pace, not rush into something. 

it was really good and rewarding! I feel like we are a tiny bit ahead now too, with almost an extra day to just help other people out on friday before maybe trying to go for one or two of the stretch goals and then doing lab 5.

Looking forward to it!
