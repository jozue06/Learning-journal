#Learning Journal day 6

###January 13th 2018

**PHEW** today was long, but really rewarding. we had to work on a lot of new ideas in a short period of time form learning them for lab 3. it was good though.

i was excited to go to class and learn and be challenged and try to overcome them. it was a good day.

it was good also to have more interaction with the other students today. they helped me a lot, even just by listening to me verbalize my problems and hurdles, and i was able to help them as well.

had to have a lot of patients with myself too, i wanted to get done with the "minimal" stuff early to try to reach one of the stretch goals, but I didn't get any of them. but that is ok too, i'm glad i was able to submit something i was proud of.

it was also good to get the html+css stuff in line a little better too. had to go back to the book for that, which was a good thing to learn.

googled a lot of stuff too, but i don't think we should feel shame for that, its been helpful!
