#Learning Journal 201 day 9

####January 17th 2018

The classes are getting more and more interesting. things are coming together! I think I'm really going to enjoy the pair programing thing. we'll see.  

I finally think I am able to atleast do what i need to so far in git and git hub! Rachel and Eric really helped me out there!

added a lot of different content stuff to my actual html. i believe i'm pretty ready for lab4. 

we'll see how lab 5 goes :)

I learned a lot about CSS the last two days which is good! lots of options for things. its still awkward doing all that stuff, but i really feel like a great visual does a lot for a website so i want my net presence to be great!
