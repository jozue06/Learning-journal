## learning journal day 18

## late, on Feb 16th


The past week has been tough as far as assignments!! i've gotten behind on the learning journals. I've been doing ok, learning a lot, just getting exhausted by the labs, and getting stuck on small things in the code that have taken days for me to figure out. Most of the time i just needed to refactor the code, in some cases start over almost from scratch, but i would keep trying to stuff something in :) So thats been the learning for the last week or so. Learning to take a step back, and see if I need to re-code or refactor stuff instead of beating a dead horse.
