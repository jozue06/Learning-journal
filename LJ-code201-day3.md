# learning journal code 201 day 3

Jan. 10th 2018

This is my first learning journal entry in week one!!

we are already on day 3 and we have gone though SOOO much stuff. 

i'm super into all the techy geeky code'y stuff that we are doing. i'm learning a lot about the terminal. i'm learning alot about HTML, JS, and CSS and how they all work together. 

the classes are kicking my ass, but i'm doing ok. Tired. having to get up at 6 to work for 9 hours then go to class for another 3-4 plus 2-3 h of homework at home all while riding the bus to and from everywhere is pretty grueling. but i think i'll find a ryhthmn.

I enjoyed meeting all the new people so far too.

the first day i was super stressed out. but also VERY much enjoyed the talk by Randi. so much good self-care info, and a lot on how to keep myself mentally and emotionally healthy.

git and github are also kicking my ass. still trying to work out how they all work together.
