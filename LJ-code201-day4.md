# Learning Journal day 4

## Jan. 11th 2018

Today we had lab. our second lab officially. It was very very challenging!

I started with almost a blank slate. i just had the one if else statement with a question.

I was having a hard time just thinking up interesting questions. but i kept going. cleaning the code little by little too.

then i finally got some inspiration, got through all of the answers, pretty much setup the whole 5 question thing. It was what the assignment was looking for, but i wasn't happy. anyone could type in just random gibberish and it would still log that as an actual answer, instead of yes or no.

then i overheard khoa and max talking about their for and while loops, and nested if else statments.

I thought i was going to be doing something less than they were. but i also didn't want to scrap the main thing i had already done incase i couldn't figure out what i was doing. so that sent me down a rabbit whole! finally i found something i could work with, but it wasn't workign exactly like i wanted, so i asked the TA shamarke to help, and he was a little stumped too, but he eventually worked it out.

now i'm trying to integrate our litle while loop into more questions and answers and points, but it is not working. I need to eat :)
