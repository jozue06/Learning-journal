Feeling the Bern today ;)

Saturday with LAB 5 killed me! :) I rested all day Sunday, and still haven't recovered back to %100 today yet. And we are now working on lab6 - Salmon Cookies!! For some reason I feel more confident in this one, but WE WILL SEE!

Deff. feeling the fatigue tho! Lots to take in and do. But I can do it!
